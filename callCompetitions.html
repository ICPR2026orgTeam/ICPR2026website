        <h2>Call for Competition Proposal</h2>
<p>The ICPR 2026 Organizing Committee invites proposals for competitions that aim at evaluating the performance of algorithms and methods related to pattern recognition. You are cordially invited to submit a proposal, that should contain the following information: </p>




<ul>
<li> Contest title and abstract </li>
<li> A brief description of the competition, including what the particular task under evaluation is, why this competition is of interest to the ICPR community, and the expected number of participants </li>
<li> An outline of the competition schedule </li>
<li> Description of the dataset to be used, and the evaluation process and metrics for submitted methods </li>
<li> The names, contact information, and brief CVs of the competition organizers, outlining previous experience in performance evaluation and/or organizing competitions  </li>
</ul>


        <p> The following rules shall apply to the accepted Competitions </p>
<li> The name of competition must be standardized by starting with "ICPR 2026" e.g. "ICPR 2024 Competition on …" or "ICPR 2026 … Competition." </li>
<li> Datasets used in the competitions must be made available after the end of the competitions. Specifically, the training data and ground truth must be publicly released and there must be a way to evaluate performance on a test set. This could take the form of an evaluation server, or the test data, ground truth, and evaluation script could be made publicly available. </li>
<li> Evaluation methodologies and metrics used must be described in detail so that results can be replicated later. Evaluation scripts must be released afterwards. </li>
<li> Each competition has to be presented with a poster at a prominent place at the conference venue, and some good competitions may be selected for oral presentation during ICPR 2026. </li>
<li> Competitions must have a sufficient number of participants (greater or equal to 3) to be able to draw meaningful conclusions. </li>
<li> Reports (full papers) on each competition will be reviewed and, if accepted (the competition ran according to plan, attracted a minimum level of participation and is appropriately described), will be published in the ICPR 2026 conference proceedings. </li>
<li> Participants should not have access to the ground-truth test dataset until the end of the competition. The evaluation should be done by the organizers. </li>
