  website : "tba"
  acronym : "HGVA"
  resume : " <p>Human attention modeling, including human gaze modeling, eye tracking, have been key areas of focus in computer vision and pattern recognition research over the past decade. These dynamic fields have evolved from various perspectives, shaped by the diverse expertise and objectives of researchers. Despite recent advancements in technologies such as large vision and language models, these innovations have yet to be fully integrated into current research. Additionally, while the potential applications of gaze estimation, attention prediction and eye tracking across images, videos, and audio are vast, there remains a lack of groundbreaking approaches that push the boundaries of the field.</p>
  <p> The Workshop on Human Gaze and Visual Attention Modeling aims to address this gap by providing a platform for introducing novel ideas and methodologies in human attention modeling, and gaze estimation and eye tracking. The workshop will also explore the intersection of these fields with emerging domains, such as human-computer interaction (HCI), robotics, autonomous systems and medical image analysis. By highlighting the broader, yet still underexplored, opportunities of gaze and human-attention and eye tracking research in real-world applications, we aim to spark new interdisciplinary collaborations.</p>
<p>Through this workshop, we aim to encourage forward-looking discussions that move beyond conventional computer vision applications and address meaningful real-world challenges. Our goal is to inspire the next wave of research and broaden the impact of human visual attention, eye-tracking, and gaze-based methods across diverse industries and domains.</p>

  id : "WS25"
  acronym : "RRPR"
  website : "https://tc22-team.github.io/rrpr2026"
  resume : "<p>The topic is Reproducible Research (RR) in direct relation to the Pattern Recognition domains, corresponding to most of the ICPR topics where research results rely on algorithms and code implementation. This workshop is an important activity of the newly created TC-22, specifically on computational reproducibility. As in all previous editions, RRPR 2026 is intended as both a short participative course on computational reproducibility, leading to open discussions with the participants, and also as a practical workshop on how to actually practice RR. In addition, another key goal for gathering the research community is to further advance the scientific aspects of reproducibility specifically in pattern recognition research. The call for papers includes three main tracks: (1) RR frameworks (including experiences, frameworks, or complete platforms), (2) RR results focusing on the quality of the reproducible research results, and (3) short papers. RRPR short papers are tailored to allow authors the extra space needed to document the steps they have taken to make their regular ICPR submission more reproducible. Sometimes this valuable information is not made available in conference papers, but doing so certainly grows awareness and increases visibility for reproducibility as a core aspect of pattern recognition research. RRPR is also an excellent forum for ICPR authors to share and discuss best practices in reproducibility, thereby advancing the field.</p>
<p>Reproducibility is an important topic in general and particularly important for PhD students
and young researchers to learn about the best practices in research, including not only the
scientific paper, but also the source code and the data. The special track is also related to
the Deep Learning and Geometry fields where reproducibility and reliability are key points.
The RRPR workshop has special relevance in ICPR 2026 since this time the conference
will grant a Reproducibility Badge to authors, to recognize and celebrate the effort of authors towards trustworthy reproducible research, transparency, and reliable science. A selection of papers will be presented in RRPR and all ICPR attendees are welcomed to participate in this workshop, for which we expect substantial discussions around computational reproducibility.</p>

  resume : "<p>Bacterial infections are the second-leading cause of death globally. Antimicrobial resistance threatens the effectiveness of modern healthcare and is recognized by the WHO as one of the top global public health threats. Infections also lead to significant economic costs, further motivating the urgent need to develop novel techniques for monitoring spread, develop accessible and accurate diagnostics, and tracking information spread and societal impact. These urgent challenges all require different forms of pattern recognition. We envision a workshop covering three broad topics: (i) diagnostics based on biomedical image and video analysis, (ii) bioinformatics as a tool for surveillance and prediction of spread, and (iii) artificial intelligence for analysis of communication strategies and societal response.  </p>

<p>Technical pattern recognition challenges central to each topic could for (i) for example be: DL for highly skewed datasets, rare case and anomaly detection, explainable AI, low computational demand networks for point of care diagnostics, real-time video analysis of pathogen growth, and domain adapted evaluation approaches. For (ii) for example: genomic sequence pattern analysis for resistance and emerging pathogen detection, GNNs for modeling transmission networks and co-occurrence networks for tracing resistance genes across populations, time series analysis of genomic data for modeling spread and mutations,  and forecasting outbreaks. For (iii), for example: NLP for detection of misinformation patterns, information diffusion modeling, behavioural response analysis, and multi-modal AI for understanding how communication strategies affect the societal response in emergency situations.</p>"

  acronym :  "GenAAI 2026"
  website : "tba"
  resume: "<p>Key Workshop Highlights – GenAAI-2026</p>
  
<p>1.	Generative Video Models as Autonomous Reasoning Engines: This theme examines how diffusion-based video models, 3D-aware world models, and large multimodal transformers can serve as cognitive backbones for agentic systems. Participants will explore how generative priors improve temporal coherence, fill in missing frames, simulate potential outcomes, and support high-level reasoning over complex dynamic scenes. By integrating planning modules and feedback loops, generative agents can autonomously interpret human activities, detect anomalies, and propose future scene evolutions.</p>
<p>2.	Agentic AI for Real-World Environments: Agentic AI introduces capabilities such as autonomous task decomposition, context-aware decision-making, and self-optimization. This segment focuses on how these properties enhance video understanding in challenging real-world conditions—crowded surveillance scenes, variable lighting, occlusions, abrupt motion patterns, and multi-agent interactions. Discussions will center on vision-language-action models, tool-use agents, embodied decision systems, and reinforcement learning frameworks designed to operate in unconstrained environments.</p>
<p>3.	Spatiotemporal Representation Learning & Predictive Modeling: High-quality video understanding depends on structured spatiotemporal representations. This section explores world models, graph neural video architectures, motion-aware transformers, and predictive generative models that anticipate future states of complex scenes. Use cases include trajectory prediction, pedestrian intent estimation, environmental hazard forecasting, and robotics navigation. The session will also investigate multimodal fusion across video, LiDAR, IMU, and audio, enabling agents to form a holistic perception of real-world environments.</p>
