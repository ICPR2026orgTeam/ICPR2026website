         <h2>Call for Tutorials</h2>
         <p>
           The ICPR 2026 Organizing Committee invites proposals for tutorials in
           conjunction with the 28th International Conference on Pattern
           Recognition, which will be held at Lyon, France, during August 17-21,
           2026. We seek tutorials on emerging research topics, core techniques,
           and application areas that are of interest within the ICPR
           community. An effective and informative tutorial should provide a
           broad introduction to the chosen research area as well as in-depth
           coverage of selected advanced topics.
         </p>

         <p>  
           Proposals that focus exclusively on the presenters' own work or
           commercial presentations are not acceptable.
         </p>
         <h3>Guideline for Submitting Tutorial Proposals</h3>

         To propose a tutorial, a PDF file containing the information outlined
         below must be submitted by email to tutorials@icpr2026.org.
