         <h2>Call for Tutorials</h2>
         <p>
           The ICPR 2026 Organizing Committee invites proposals for tutorials in
           conjunction with the 28th International Conference on Pattern
           Recognition, which will be held at Lyon, France, during August 17-21,
           2026. We seek tutorials on emerging research topics, core techniques,
           and application areas that are of interest within the ICPR
           community. An effective and informative tutorial should provide a
           broad introduction to the chosen research area as well as in-depth
           coverage of selected advanced topics.
         </p>

         <p>  
           Proposals that focus exclusively on the presenters' own work or
           commercial presentations are not acceptable.
         </p>
         <h3>Guideline for Submitting Tutorial Proposals</h3>

         To propose a tutorial, a PDF file containing the information outlined
         below must be submitted by email to tutorials@icpr2026.org.

         The proposal should contain the following information:

<ul>
<li> Proposed tutorial title</li>
<li>   Names, titles, affiliations, emails, and brief bio sketches of the people delivering the tutorial</li>
<li>   Name and email of the lead person for communication and responsibility</li>
<li> Preference for half- or full-day event (the latter requires a brief justification)</li>
<li>   Tutorial description with list of topics to be covered, along with a brief outline and important details; any innovative pedagogy employed; any hands-on participation, etc.</li>
<li>   Expected target audience, in terms of both composition and estimated number of attendees</li>
<li>   List of citations and/or URLs to relevant publications and/or products of the tutorial presenters and other relevant related work</li>
<li>   A description of how this proposal relates to tutorials/short courses appearing at the last two ICPRs (and also other major related conferences since 2022)</li>
<li>   A description of and/or URLs to any planned materials or resources to be distributed to attendees</li>
</ul>

proposed structure, overall relevance, and how it complements the main
conference.</p>

<h3>Costs and Terms</h3>

         <p>Tutorials are free for all participants with full ICPR2026

           tutorial should register for it and will be admitted on a first come,
           first served basis.
         </p>


         <p>
           ICPR 2026 reserves the right to cancel a tutorial if the responsibilities are not fulfilled by
           the proponent, or if too few attendees register for the event, or for any unforeseen reason.
