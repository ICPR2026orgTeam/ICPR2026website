  <h1> Instructions for Reviewers </h1>


<p>
Before reviewing, please read the following eight instructions carefully:  
</p>
<ol>

<li> Log onto CMT and confirm that you can access your review assignments. If you are unable to access your review assignments, please let us know immediately by sending an email to <a href="mailto:pc@icpr2026.org">pc@icpr2026.org</a>. </li>

<li> ICPR 2026 has a single blind review policy, and so each submission must include the list of authors and their affiliations. If you have a conflict-of-interest with any of the papers assigned to you, please let us know immediately by sending an email to <a href="mailto:pc@icpr2026.org">pc@icpr2026.org</a>.  </li>

<li> If a paper exceeds the 15-page limit (including figures, tables and references) in the Springer LNCS format, please let us know immediately by sending an email to <a href="mailto:pc@icpr2026.org">pc@icpr2026.org</a> and we will let you know whether you will have to review the paper or not.  </li>

<li> If a paper appears to have violated the Springer LNCS format (e.g., a two-column paper instead of a single column), please let us know immediately by sending an email to <a href="mailto:pc@icpr2026.org">pc@icpr2026.org</a> and we will let you know whether you will have to review the paper or not.  </li>

<li> Some papers may have a supplementary file. Supplementary files are optional and you are not obliged to look over them. Note that if such a paper is accepted for publication in the ICPR proceedings, the paper must be able to stand on its own, without depending on the supplementary material which will not be published.   </li>

<li> Uploading a paper to any third-party server would constitute a breach of confidentiality and is strictly prohibited. You are not permitted to use AI tools (such as ChatGPT or Gemini) in order to compose reviews. You must write your own review for each paper.     </li>

<li> Please be specific and detailed in your comments as much as possible. Therefore, one-sentence reviews are unacceptable. For example, it is not sufficient to just say “This work is not novel”. You must give specific references and justify your comments. Similarly, if you say, “Experiments are insufficient”, then you must clearly enumerate the list of missing experiments. Please also be polite and factual in your comments.</li>  

<li> You may receive some papers that are somewhat outside your area of expertise. The Program Chairs and Area Chairs are dealing with a total of over 1400 submissions, overseeing hundreds of reviewers, and expect to see over 4200 reviews by the end of the process. It is not feasible for them to manually adjust the papers assigned to individual reviewers; so please do your best to review the papers you have been assigned.   </li>

</ol>
<p>
If you have any questions or comments about the review process, please always remember to send an email to <a href="mailto:pc@icpr2026.org">pc@icpr2026.org</a>. We are grateful for your service to the IAPR community! Your timely effort is vital to the success of our conference and community.
